## Sequence Tasks in the Real World

Sequence models are designed to handle data where the order of elements matters. Here are some real-world tasks involving sequential data:

| Task                         | Input (x)                                        | Output (y)                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Speech transcription         | Audio waveform                                       | Text transcript                                  |
| Melody generation            | Short seed melody or empty input or texture prompts  | Music Snippets                        |
| Sentiment analysis           | "I didn’t enjoy the film at all."               | Negative sentiment (e.g., ★☆☆☆☆)                 |
| Genomic pattern detection    | ACTGCTAGCGTTAGCTGA                               | Highlighted segments corr                    |
| Language translation         | "Shall we go for a walk?"                      | "我们去散步好吗？"                   |
| Entity tagging               | "Yesterday, Tom met Eliza in Paris."            | Tom → Person, Eliza → Person, Paris → Location  |
| Time series forecasting      | Historical temperature readings                 | Predicted future temperature                     |

> 🧠 Note: These tasks may involve different input/output sequence lengths and modalities (text, audio, video, etc.), but they all benefit from the ability of sequence models (like RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers) to capture temporal or contextual dependencies.
