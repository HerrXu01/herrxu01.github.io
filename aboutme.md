## Projects

### Practical Course: Large-Scale Machine Learning
[View Project](https://github.com/HerrXu01/Practical_Course_Long_Range_Interactions_in_Crystal_Structures)
- **Topic:** Long-Range Interactions in Crystal Structures
- Investigated the capabilities of SOTA models to capture long-range interatomic interactions within crystal structures.
- Explored if the physics-inspired biases on the target (energies) would help lower the prediction error.

### Practical Course: Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling and Simulation
[View Project](https://github.com/HerrXu01/Master_Praktikum__Machine_Learning_in_Crowd_Modeling_and_Simulation)
- Implemented approaches to model crowd dynamics.
- Studied the simulation software named Vadere.
- Applied machine learning methods for the analysis of dynamical systems, covering manifold learning and bifurcation analysis.

### Code Assignments of Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data
[View Project](https://github.com/HerrXu01/MLGS_projects)
